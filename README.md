Deep Reinforcement Learning: Implementation of deep RL algorithms including Q-learning and policy gradients using Python 2.7/3.4. These algorithms are then applied and tuned on openAI Gym environments. In addition, a project was completed with the end-game of a fully trained, robust virtual AI racer for the online racing game TORCS.
